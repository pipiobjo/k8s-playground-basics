Now its time to show your skills. Therefor an simple greeting application is provided.

== Our greeting application

Test the endpoints without anything than the application do the following:

.Start the application
[source%nowrap,bash]
----
$ cd 03-custom-application/service/greeting
$ go run cmd/main.go
{"level":"info","name":"blueprint-greeting","version":"","time":"2022-08-28T17:00:16+02:00","message":"starting service blueprint"}
{"level":"info","port":8081,"time":"2022-08-28T17:00:16+02:00","message":"starting health probes"}
{"level":"info","port":8080,"time":"2022-08-28T17:00:16+02:00","message":"starting rest endpoint"}
----

.Greeting endpoint
[source%nowrap,bash]
----
$ curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/greeting/k8s-team | jq
{
  "id": 3,
  "name": "k8s-team",
  "message": "Servus, k8s-team! Well met!"
}
----

.Version endpoint
[source%nowrap,bash]
----

$ curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/version | jq
{
"version": ""
}
----


.Startup probe endpoint
[source%nowrap,bash]
----
$ curl -s http://localhost:8081/start | jq
{
  "ok": true
}
----


.Readiness probe endpoint
[source%nowrap,bash]
----
$ curl -s http://localhost:8081/ready | jq
{
  "ok": true
}
----


.Live probe endpoint
[source%nowrap,bash]

== Exercise

Provide this stateless application in the kubernetes which considers the following points:

* Provide the 03-custom-application/service/greeting/config/config.yaml in the pod in /config
** Take a look at Configmaps https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/
* Use the probes rest endpoints
** Access to the probe endpoints is only possible from within the k8s cluster
* Provide the application with multiple replicas
** Let it dynamically scale based on cpu and / or memory consumption
* Make the greeting endpoints available from outside the cluster via http and https using ingress (nginx ingress is already installed)
** Take a look at https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/
** Target endpoints
*** localhost:48080/greeting/v1/greeting/
*** localhost:48443/greeting/v1/greeting/
* Provide a setup which could handle multiple environments / stages (dev / test / prod).
** Consider using kustomize or helm
